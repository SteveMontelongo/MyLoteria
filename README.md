# MyLoteria

Author: Steve Montelongo

MyLoteria is a card-shuffling application that draws a card from a deck of cards. The deck is initialized with La Loteria themed cards; however, any card can be created as long as you provide the name and image file.
The full application will allow the user to do the following.
1. The user can record custom voice-overs for each individual card.
2. The user can choose between AI TTS or their own custom reocrding when calling the name of the drawn card.
3. The user can see the gallery of cards that are used during play.
4. The user can adjust the speed of play for the deck of cards.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **User can adjust the speed pf play**
- [x] **User can choose between TTS AI voice or custom recording when a drawn card is called**
- [x] **User can see the gallery of cards being used**

## Notes

I do not own the images of the cards. This project is for educational and entertaiment purposes only.
The purpose of this project is to create an easy solution for managing Loteria cards. This application
will be able to shuffle, draw, and customize the cards as the user see fits without the burden of managing
physical cards. This eliminates the need for storage, shuffling, and maintaining physical cards.
